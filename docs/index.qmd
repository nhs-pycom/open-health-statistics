## What is open-source?

Open-source is the practice of publishing the source code of a software project so that anyone can read, modify, re-use, and improve that software.

As set out in the [NHS Digital Service Manual](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/service-standard/12-make-new-source-code-open), public services are built with public money--so unless there's a good reason not to (for security reasons for example), all code produced by the NHS should be made publicly available. 

> Open source means that the NHS can give our work back to the people who fund it, the public: allowing them to more easily join our staff, more quickly develop products to support us, and better understand and trust the work we do on their behalf. 
> [NHS Open-source Policy](https://github.com/nhsx/open-source-policy)

To this end, the [Department of Health & Social Care has recently made a commitment](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data-draft/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data-draft) to make all new NHS code open source and published under appropriate licences such as [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and [OGLv3](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

## The growth of open-source in healthcare

The ‘cambrian explosion’ visualisation captures the rise in open-source software in recent years. From the first open-source repository published by NHS England in 2014, to over 1,200 today. Python, R, and webdev tools (HTML, css, Ruby, PHP) are the most popular languages.
