We have been collecting statistics on open-source repositories of NHS and related healthcare organisations. We use the open [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/orgs) to pull data from open (public) repositoiries as `.json` files, then flatten the data into `pandas` dataframes for analysis. This has produced an interesting dataset that has lots of potential for further analysis and visualisations.
